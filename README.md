# 404-Found Presents: The Chopping Block

The Chopping Block is a Unity-built health equity game created from scratch by 404-Found to help students and younger kids build stronger food knowledge through play. The project was designed around a simple idea: healthy eating education works better when children are engaged, rewarded, and curious, not just instructed.

This app responds to a real nutrition problem. Too many kids are growing up surrounded by poor food choices, weak nutrition habits, and limited exposure to interactive learning tools that make healthy eating feel relevant. The Chopping Block turns that challenge into an active gameplay loop where players tap healthy foods, earn coins, unlock content, and learn more about what they eat.

Chopping Block Demo V2 is included in this repository for the beta release, and the README demo links route to the live beta demo page.

## What The App Does

- Teaches healthy food recognition through fast, approachable gameplay
- Rewards good choices with points, coins, and unlockable content
- Uses a Trophy Case to turn progress into nutrition discovery
- Supports replayability with score chasing, unlocks, and persistent progress
- Frames food education as something fun, not passive

## Why It Matters
